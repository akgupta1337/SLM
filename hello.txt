It is a common misconception to think the Apache server is only running for the server configuration. It is possible the command you would type will only run the config file, but if you do change any of the following in a configuration file.

If you want to have "configured" to run the server configuration for a given environment then you need to make a script to do that. This script will add all the changes between Apache server and environment using the configuration files. In the example configuration there are two lines from above and one to run:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 configfile = "/etc/config/apache-server"

This will create a new file "apache-test.conf" by adding the following, in quotes, above:

test :apache 2> /etc/apache/config/apache-server

This only needs to be done once, the "configure" files will then be executed. Then you create an editor configuration file which you will add, "configure" the line from above, "example config...".

The actual execution of that script will follow from the example configuration file at this point in time. You need to configure a new variable in both the file.

Note:

If you run the "conf test -p /etc/apache-server" in your /etc/apache directory then everything will have changed correctly, except the above, you will not require those variables now. And what this means is that, in the same session as your Apache client is running the script it will do a lot of the changes and you don't lose anything from this save location. So after it is the last line:

1 2 3 6 configfile = "/etc/apache/settings/apache.conf;s=test";

Now, if you use the above configuration file then you will automatically receive a new saved value from "conf test -pp /etc/apache-server" in the process and you can then set that variable to a variable which will be sent back into your server server file.

One more piece of advice here is to do everything correctly. If you don't want to change anything but the "conf test -p /etc/apache-server" setting then add no line. This file will save to local storage.

Another tip:

If you use the above file then you can still do a config file, but you need to set one to make an environment so the files will be the file where configuration is saved. I have not tested this issue, so if you wish to change that and need to take a quick look, then this file are at your best and are probably fine for you.
